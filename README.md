## About OpenWorkoutTracker

OpenWorkoutTracker is a django-built webapp for managing your exercise and fitness routines and goals. It allows you to organize your fitness routines and record your workouts by date. 

OpenWorkoutTracker allows you to visualize your progress and keep you on track. It also includes built in exercises that you can include in your workouts or routines, and allows you to add your own if you want.

### Purpose

There are many apps that provide the same functionality as OpenWorkoutTracker, however I have found that most of them are either riddled with ads, or require you to pay either a one off fee or even regularly through a subscription service. This lead me to create openWorkoutTracker to allow people to get the same service through a self hosted webapp.

## Tech Stack

- Python & Django
- Bootstrap 4
- HTML5, JS&JQuery

## Features

- Secure multi-user web app with authentication via Django Allauth
- Highly responsive design suitable for use on mobile phones or desktop computers
- Includes a REST api
